## Project
1. Separation of concerns
    * [Model](https://github.com/davboone/AstroChallenge/tree/main/model)
    * [View](https://github.com/davboone/AstroChallenge/tree/main/views)
    * [Controller](https://github.com/davboone/AstroChallenge/tree/main/controller)
2. Route incoming URLs using Fat-Free
    * [Index](https://github.com/davboone/AstroChallenge/blob/main/index.php)
3. Has a clearly defined database layer using PDO and prepared statements
    * All data in the site is generated by calling on a [data-layer](https://github.com/davboone/AstroChallenge/blob/main/model/data-layer.php) object
4. Data can be viewed and info can be added
    * [Register](http://cbaxter.greenriverdev.com/SDEV328/AstroChallenge/register) a new account (For grading purposes, sign up as an admin)
    * Login with registered account, to view data and update or add info head over to the [admin portal](http://cbaxter.greenriverdev.com/SDEV328/AstroChallenge/adminportal)
5. Use OOP, define multiple classes, including one inheritance
    * [Classes](https://github.com/davboone/AstroChallenge/tree/main/classes) can be found here
    * Admin inherits from User
6. Contains full Docblocks for all PHP files and follows PEAR Standards
    * [Model](https://github.com/davboone/AstroChallenge/tree/main/model) is an example of so

7. Has validation.
   * [Server side](https://github.com/davboone/AstroChallenge/blob/main/model/validation.php)
    * [Client side](https://github.com/davboone/AstroChallenge/blob/main/views/register.html)
8. All code is clean, clear, and well-documented. DRY is practiced.
   
9. The submission shows adequate effort for a final project in a full-stack web development course.

    * This project required a good amount of external research. Challenging process that tested what we learned in class well.
